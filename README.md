## Hey, I'm Drew ðŸ‘‹


Over the last few years Iâ€™ve worked with small to medium-sized businesses all the way up to giants like Microsoft. I've also taught at App Academy, the most prestigious web development bootcamp in the United States.

As a software engineer, Iâ€™ve helped build everything from complex UIs and animations, web scrapers, to full stack web and mobile applications, working alone or as part of a team. And if youâ€™ve attended an online college, youâ€™ve likely used code Iâ€™ve worked on.
